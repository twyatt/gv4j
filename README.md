# About
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twyatt/gv4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twyatt/gv4j)

Unofficial Google Voice API for Java created by reverse engineering the Google Voice mobile site.

See the [Wiki](../../wiki) for more details.

## Caveats
Since Google does not provide an official API for Google Voice, the web requests which GV4J relies on could break at anytime and without warning.

## Dependencies
[gson](https://github.com/google/gson), [guava](https://github.com/google/guava), [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/download), [okhhtp and okio](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
